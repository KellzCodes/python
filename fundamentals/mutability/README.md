### `is` keyword on mutable data types

`is` tells you if two objects are the same

`x` and `y` are two different lists that are equivalent but they are not the same object

setting `y` = `x` is creating another name or alias for x. Now y and x are interchangeable when referencing the same object. 

Any operation we do on both will affect both of them.
