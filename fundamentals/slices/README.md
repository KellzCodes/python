A slice is an operator that we can use on a collection data type. 

A slice allows us to actually get a subset of the collection. 

So we can slice a list, string, tuple, etc. into a new list, string, tuple, etc. 

When you take a slice of a data type, you can pass a start value, a stop value, and a step value. These are the indices you want to retrieve from this list.
