## What is a property?

Properties are special attributes that make it so we can enforce specific behavior when we are accessing or trying to modify an attribute.

## The issues with attributes

The problem with attributes is that they can be modified from outside of the class to anything even if it doesn't make sense

## Private Attributes

In Python, since there is no access modifiers (private, public or protected keywords) to denote an attribute as private you prefix it with a `_`. The attribute can still be accessed and modified like all other attributes but the `_` prefix denotes that it should not be, this is a Python convention.

```
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    self._salary = 0
```

## Getters and Setters

### Legacy Property

Pythonâ€™s `property()` is the Pythonic way to avoid formal getter and setter methods in your code. This function allows you to turn class attributes into properties or managed attributes. Since `property()` is a built-in function, you can use it without importing anything.

```
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    self._salary = 0

  def set_salary(self, salary):
    if salary < 0:
      raise ValueError("Hey, this is invalid!")
    self._salary = salary

  def get_salary(self):
    return round(self._salary)

  salary = property(get_salary, set_salary)

p = Person("KD")
p.salary = 101.1111
print(p.salary)
```

Output:

101
