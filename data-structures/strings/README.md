## operations on characters

Every character in a string is going to be stored in memory using a fixed amount of bytes. 

All of the operations that we are going to perform on a single character in a string are going to be `O(1)` time operations. 

### traversing a string

`O(N)` time and `O(1)` space

### Copying a string

`O(N)` time and space

### Accessing a character in a string

`O(1)` time and space

### Inserting a value in a string

`O(N)` time and space

In Python, strings are immutable. You cannot alter them after you've created them. If you want to alter a string, you actually have to create a brand new string. You have to copy the string then create a new string with the new character.
