# Data Structures

Coding interviews. Problem-solving skills. Algorithm questions. What do you call the intersection of their Venn Diagram?

Hint: it starts with "data" and ends with "structures".

## What Are Data Structures?

The elementary particles of algorithms, data structures are woven into the very fabric of computer science and are essential building blocks of many a solution to coding interview problems.

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

## Memory

The bedrock of all data structures, memory is the underlying concept that you absolutely need to know in order to understand why data structures work the way they do.

## Big O Notation

The speed and memory usage of an algorithm aren't necessarily fixed; they might change depending on the input. So how do we express the performance of an algorithm then?

Enter Big O Notation, a powerful tool that allows us to generalize the space-time complexity of an algorithm as a function of its input size.
